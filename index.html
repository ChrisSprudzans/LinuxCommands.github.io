  <p>
  Linux is an open-source operating system, similar to other operating systems you might be more familiar with such as Windows or macOS. It's the software on a computer that enables applications and the computer operator to access the devices on the computer to perform desired functions.
  </p>
  <p>
  The term "Linux" is also used to refer to the Linux kernel, which is the core of the Linux operating system. The kernel is the heart of the operating system and interacts directly with the hardware of the computer, managing resources like memory and processing power, and allowing all the different hardware components to communicate with each other.

  <h2>History of Linux</h2>
  <p>
  Linux was first created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a then-student at the University of Helsinki. Torvalds built Linux as a free and open-source alternative to Minix, another Unix clone that was predominantly used in academia. Today, Linux systems are used throughout the world in servers, desktops, smartphones, and more.
