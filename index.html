<h1>Linux Commands</h1>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is Linux?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
  Linux is an open-source operating system, similar to other operating systems you might be more familiar with such as Windows or macOS. It's the software on a computer that enables applications and the computer operator to access the devices on the computer to perform desired functions.
  </p>
  <p>
  The term "Linux" is also used to refer to the Linux kernel, which is the core of the Linux operating system. The kernel is the heart of the operating system and interacts directly with the hardware of the computer, managing resources like memory and processing power, and allowing all the different hardware components to communicate with each other.
  </p>
  <h2>History of Linux</h2>
  <p>
  Linux was first created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a then-student at the University of Helsinki. Torvalds built Linux as a free and open-source alternative to Minix, another Unix clone that was predominantly used in academia. Today, Linux systems are used throughout the world in servers, desktops, smartphones, and more.

        <p>
            In Linux, like in any other operating system, files and directories (folders) are a core part of managing and organizing data. File operation commands are the instructions that you give to the computer to manage these files and directories. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here are some of the operations you might want to perform, explained in simple terms:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="blue-heading">Create a file:</span> Just like you would create a new document in Word, you can create a new file in Linux using the command <span class="emphasize">touch filename</span>.</li>
        
            <li><span class="blue-heading">Read a file:</span> This is like opening a file to see what's inside it. In Linux, you would use the command <span class="emphasize">cat filename</span>.</li>
        
            <li><span class="blue-heading">Edit a file:</span> This means changing the contents of a file. In Linux, you can use text editors like <span class="emphasize">nano</span>, <span class="emphasize">vi</span>, or <span class="emphasize">emacs</span> to edit files. For example, to edit a file using nano, you would use the command <span class="emphasize">nano filename</span>.</li>
        
            <li><span class="blue-heading">Move a file:</span> This is like dragging a file from one folder to another. In Linux, you would use the command <span class="emphasize">mv oldname newname</span> to rename a file, or <span class="emphasize">mv filename directoryname/</span> to move a file to a different directory.</li>
        
            <li><span class="blue-heading">Copy a file:</span> This is making a duplicate of a file in another location, just like copy-pasting a document. In Linux, you would use the command <span class="emphasize">cp source destination</span> to copy a file, or <span class="emphasize">cp -r sourcedir destinationdir</span> to copy a directory.</li>
        
            <li><span class="blue-heading">Delete a file:</span> This is like moving a file to the Recycle Bin or Trash on your computer. In Linux, you would use the command <span class="emphasize">rm filename</span> to delete a file, or <span class="emphasize">rm -r directoryname</span> to delete a directory.</li>
        
            <li><span class="blue-heading">Change permissions:</span> In Linux, each file and directory has a set of permissions, which determine who can read, write, or execute it. Changing permissions is like setting who can view or edit a document. In Linux, you would use the command <span class="emphasize">chmod permissions filename</span> to change the permissions of a file.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>
            Remember to replace 'filename', 'oldname', 'newname', 'source', 'destination', 'sourcedir', 'destinationdir', 'directoryname', and 'permissions' with your actual filenames, directory names, and permissions.
